It's pretty self-explained. Use a different configuration file for each network. (see technoirc.php for an example)
Make sure you setup owner host in the config to your host.
Start with `php <config file>`
When the bot connects, assign it to its first channel with /msg <bot nick> .assign <channel>
From there, you can get to know the bot by using the ".help" command.

I take no responsibility in anything related to this bot. I only made it because I felt like it.
Yes, I know it's poorly coded and has a terrible structure. My coding style has changed drastically since I finished 
this bot.
The point is that it works. :)
I would prefer you didn't take credit for my work, but I have no say in that.

I am no longer interested in PHP. I've been working with perl and my pircd fork, juno. 
http://github.com/cooper879/juno-ircd; but I'm even more busy now with TS6-compatable perl IRC services and
Chakora - http://github.com/iElijah101/Chakora
I have also written PHP services for the InspIRCd linking protocol at http://github.com/cooper879/inspircd-php-services, 
although I no longer work with InspIRCd. I find it not worth the bugs and bloats.
